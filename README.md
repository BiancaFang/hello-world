# hello-world
I reckon this might be a place to store any thoughts, ideas and other interesting staff.

Ok, BiancaFang here, this is a new username that I've never used before in any other websites, hope it will give a fresh start. 
It's a little bit bitter to say this, but I'm a physics PhD who lose interest in regarding doing physics as my life goal. Now good luck to me on coding.
